To get this application on an android phone install OpenMouseInstaller.apk (it might be not the latest version of the app because I usually upload new versions every 2 days)
and download auxilary file OpenMouseHelper.java on your computer to connect it to this application.
You just have to change your config files in OpenMouseHelper.kt (https://github.com/keramicheskiy/OpenMouseHelper) for yourself and press "RUN"
